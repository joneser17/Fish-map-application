# Fish-map-application
Using leaflet.js to map data of fish caught onto map.

Note: Application will still work without local host, it just wont save to the database.

Testing:
For testing, I used node with index.js to create a server on port 3000. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Example:

Working on:
1) Cleaning up the page to look nice.
2) Ability to remove markers.
3) Change base64 encoding to save file on server and then add link to db.
4) Styling.
